Requirements:

- Create a CLI (Command Line App) to allow you to play a game

- There needs to be a grid which will be a "Map" of any size

- The player's goal is to reach the top right, starting at the bottom left

- The player can move Up, Down, Left or Right (But not off the Map)

- Each move there's a small chance for either an Enemy or an Item
  to spawn at that spot

- If an Item, the stats get added automatically to the Player permanently
  along with some text to show what it is

- If an Enemy, the Player will "fight" the Enemy until one of them runs out of HP.
  The Player permanently loses any HP lost during the fight. Damage = Attack - Defense

- The Player wins the game if they reach the "goal" in the top right and loses
  if they lose all their HP before reaching the goal

Each Player, Item and Enemy will have:

1. Health Points
2. Attack Points
3. Defense Points
4. An Emoji "Sprite"
